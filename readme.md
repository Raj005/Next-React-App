## Description

I focused more on Architecture and Design for creating a scalable and maintainable performant app. I used design patterns like design by composition, Dependency Injection and Solid principles. Components follow the Pod structure (all related files in one place) and also I preferred SSR (Server side rendering) because it is more performant than CSR and also SEO, SEM, and conversion rate depend on it.

Tech stack -
I used Nextjs for SSR and expressjs for Server. Reactjs for UI rendering and for styling I used styled components

## How to use

Using NPM (you can use Yarn also)

- npm install or yarn install (to install dependencies)
- npm run dev or yarn dev (running the server on localhost:3000)
- npm run test or yarn test (to run tests)
